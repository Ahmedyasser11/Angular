## Metrico

This is my project, which was created to collect and visualize [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about) metrics over the lifetime of a website.

The data source is [PageSpeed Insights API](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started).

On special charts, users could see how [CrUX](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/about/) and [Lighthouse data](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) metrics change over time.

At the moment, I am not working on this project, so I decided to make it public. I hope that someone may find it helpful to do something cool!
